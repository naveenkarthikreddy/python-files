# A hash is a value that has a fixed length,
# and it is generated using a mathematical formula.
# Hash values are used in data compression,
# cryptology, etc. In data indexing, hash values
# are used because they have fixed length size
# regardless of the values that were used to
# generate them. It makes hash values to occupy
# minimal space compared to other values of varying
# lengths.




# A hash function employs a mathematical algorithm
# to convert the key into a hash. A collision occurs
# when a hash function
