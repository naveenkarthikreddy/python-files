# The “pointer” and “reference” both are used to point
# or refer an another variable. But, the basic
# difference among both of them is that a pointer
# variable points to a variable whose memory location
# is stored in it. The reference variable is an alias
# for a variable which is assigned to it.

# we will eventually call the object name as reference
# variable, that it there is no any other miracles for
# the name reference variable
#
# we will call them as a variable if we allocating a
# memory
#
# for the object we are not creating a new memory ,
# eventually we will use the already allocated memory
# an alias for a variable which is assigned to it.
